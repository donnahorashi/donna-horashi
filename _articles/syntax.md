**`It's best to read this document with the markdown and rendered output side-by-side to see how the markdown syntax is rendered at build time.`**

## Headers

The above is a level 2 heading, preceded by `##` and a space. 

There's nothing special about the way the Exocore processes headers— it's just standard markdown. However, each header will render with an anchor link. If you hover over a heading and click the link icon that appears, the URL in your browser will reflect the section that you clicked. Now, if you copy that URL it will link directly to the heading that you clicked.

### Heading levels

The above is a level 3 heading, preceded by `###` and a space.

Here's some advice: Only use top-level headings (preceded by `#`) for the document's title. This is a markdown standard, and the Exocore steals your first top-level heading to use as the title of the page in the final rendered output anyway. For intra-document section titles, use a level 2 heading. It's for the best.



## Examples of Wikilinks:

Here are some wikilinks:

 - [[exocore]]
 - [[seo]]
 - [[business-virtue]]
 - [[2022-02-04]].

In your local directory they are written as the title of their mardown file, surrounded by double square brackets. However, in the final render they are presented by default as the page's title. This saves you typing out the whole page title in your markdown document, and allows the Foam VSCode extension to suggest files as you type. Below you can read about how to change their presentation.

[[ginseng|You can alias a link like this]] if you don't want to keep the title. Heads up— this link goes to an article about ginseng.


[[syntax#Wikilink Embeds|This wikilink is aliased with this text, and it points to a header further down on this very page]] Under that header you will find a different sort of wikilink— an embed. The content of another note is embedded on a page.

Check out the backlinks section at the bottom of [[business-virtue|this link's]] target note. You'll find that this very article is automatically added. Backlinks are automatic, and display all the notes with internal links pointing to them.

## Wikilink Embeds

Here I've The below text is embedded, using the same wikilink syntax as normal, but with an `!` prepended. The full text of the linked note will be included.

![[abu-dhabi-postal]]

## Tables

You | can | create a table | like this.
A newline | in markdown | extends the table | vertically.
A pipe | extends the table | laterally.

## Examples of Footnotes:

Here's a simple footnote with no linebreaks in it.[^1] Each footnote is an anchor link to the bottom of the page, with a return link attached. 

If you want to add multi-paragraph footnotes, indent your second paragraph, like this.[^2]

You can put a footnote's markdown reference immediately under a paragraph, like this[^3], or clump them at the end. Either way, they will appear at the bottom in your rendered content.

[^3]: This footnote appears immediately underneath it's referring paragraph in this document's original markdown, but on the rendered website it shows at the bottom. 

Footnotes automatically form a numbered list, and can also be mapped by name, like this[^named-footnote]

## Sidenotes

Sidenotes are cool, but they need javascript. I'll figure that out soon.

## Naming files

Don't use whitespace in your filenames— instead, name-them-like-this.


[^1]: This is the first footnote. Note the return button:

[^2]: Here's a footnote with multiple paragraphs.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

[^named-footnote]: This footnote has the name 'named-footnote'. it's still numbered and appears in sequence the same way the others do, but naming it might help you manage a document with many footnotes when dealing with your local markdown.
