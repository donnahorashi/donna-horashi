# The Blog and Brain of James Arthur Liao III

This is an experimental site mixing a blog format with a zettelkasten framework for organising notes. The goal is for it to be a home for all written output.

If you are reading this as a GitHub repository, I encourage you to instead read on [james-liao.net](https://james-liao.net), where the repository is fully rendered as a website. If you are interested in producing your own similar site, pore over this repository to see how it is navigated by jekyll to automatically produce [james-liao.net](https://james-liao.net).
