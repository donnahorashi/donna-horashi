I"Ø<p>i think remilia looks on the noble chinese the same way mishima looked upon the firefighters in confessions of a mask, or on the sailors in the sailor who fell from grace with the seaâ€” they do their job, but more than that, they are their job, and they both find purpose and acquire nobility not in freedom but in stricture.m. not as individuals but as perfect representatives of their roles, gifted with a purpose and a story by the modest yet utterly crucial and harmonious role they play in the broader community. If they die, they donâ€™t matter, but they die in poetic purityâ€” when they live they donâ€™t matter either, but in this immateriality they find the plain, modest nobility of the bee in the hiveâ€” more modest, and yet more noble than most can claim to be. does the flower embody perfection to the bee, mishima wonders, for the simple fact of its perfect utility? for their harmony together?</p>

<p>sometimes i feel my life is like thatâ€” like i am walking around watching banal things that are secretly really funny and interesting and nobody is paying attention. and i ask a few questions and people improv a comedy of manners explaining banalities to me and i stand there. and then i walk away and thats my life</p>

<p>some funny things to ask ppeople with menial lives: are you a hero? whats the biggest bump in the road? where are your allies, and what are they doing?</p>

<p>if you scrape past even the small talk veneer and ask for explanations of basic decisions ppl make, they are simultaneously extremely willing to share, and unable to shareâ€” the humor comes from them introspecting in realtime and searching for an answer that isnt there. often people are be totally incapable of answering a â€˜why did youâ€¦â€™ question about say, their job or marriage, because in fact there is no why, they did not decide, they just fell into it. i think oftentimes the bigger the implication of a decision on someoneâ€™s life the LESS consideration they put into it</p>
