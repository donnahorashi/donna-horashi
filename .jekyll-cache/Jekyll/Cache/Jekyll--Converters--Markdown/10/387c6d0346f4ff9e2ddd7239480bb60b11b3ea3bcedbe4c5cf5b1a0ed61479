I"Õ<p>In abu dhabi they do not have a functioning residential postal system. everyone has a PO box, and most people donâ€™t have even a street number. addresses look like this: SW-17 Plot 46A Villa B Mâ€™eshad First, Al Fahad City, Abu Dhabi, UAE. they call residential neighbourhoods that you could walk across in 10 mins â€˜citiesâ€™, and some â€˜villagesâ€™ are as big as â€˜citiesâ€™. if you type an abu dhabi address into google maps it has no idea where it is.</p>
