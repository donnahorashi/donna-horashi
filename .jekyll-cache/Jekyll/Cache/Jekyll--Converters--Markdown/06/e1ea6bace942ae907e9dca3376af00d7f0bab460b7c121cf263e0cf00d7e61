<h2 id="how-a-harmonic-drive-gear-system-works">How a Harmonic Drive Gear System Works</h2>
<p>Harmonic drive component sets consist of only
three precision components: wave
generator, flex spline, and circular spline.</p>

<p>The wave generator is the driven element
of the transmission. the ellipse shaped
form of the wave generator is fitted
with a specially designed ball bearing.</p>

<p>The flex spline is a high-strength,
torsionally stiff, yet flexible component
with external teeth which reliably
transmits high loads.</p>

<p>The circular spline is designed as a
rigid ring with internal teeth. The
circular spline has two teeth more than
a flex spline does.</p>

<p>By inserting the wave generator into the
Flex spline the Flex spline assumes the
elliptical shape of the wave generator.</p>

<p>The rotating wave generator causes the
Flex spline to radially deform.</p>

<p>The assembled gear has two diametrically
opposed tooth engagement areas
around the major axis of the ellipse.</p>

<p>The rotation of the wave generator causes
the meshing of the flex spline and
circular splines to move around the gearâ€™s
circumference</p>

<p>since the Flex spline has two teeth less
than the circular spline, rotating the
wave generator leads to a relative
movement between the Flex spline and the
circular spline.</p>

<p>Harmonic drive gears and
servo actuators are used wherever zero
backlash, extraordinary precision, and
high reliability are required.</p>

<h2 id="advantages-over-traditional-gearing-systems">Advantages Over Traditional Gearing Systems</h2>

<p>Strain wave gearing has some advantages over traditional gearing systems such as helicalÂ¹ or planetaryÂ² gears, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No backlash</li>
  <li>Compactness and light weight</li>
  <li>High gear ratios</li>
  <li>Reconfigurable ratios within a standard housing</li>
  <li>Good resolution and excellent repeatability (linear representation) when repositioning inertial loads</li>
  <li>High torque capability</li>
  <li>Coaxial input and output shafts</li>
  <li>High gear reduction ratios are possible in a small volume (ratio from 30:1 up to 320:1 is possible in the same space in which planetary gearsÂ² typically only produce 10:1 ratio).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="note">NOTE:</h2>
<p>A ball used in a ball bearing is not a ball bearingâ€” it is just a ball. A ball bearing is the entire device in which balls are used to maintain separation between bearing races (usually rings or sliders) and eliminate friction.</p>

<p>Individual balls in a ball bearing are often incorrectly referred to as a ball bearing, but this is a synecdochic mistakeâ€” an element of the system is mistakenly used to refer to the whole</p>
