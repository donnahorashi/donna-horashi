<p>dying is a communal act— it is a giant family reunion with all those lost in your lifetime, and with generations thousands of years past. When U arrive they cheer and embrace U like a home run player returning to the dugout. U all gather watch your legacy unfold… Death MUST be conceived a as a return to the paradise of all-unity.</p>
