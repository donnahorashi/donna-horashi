I"—<p>i think remilia looks on the noble chinese the same way mishima looked upon the firefighters in confessions of a mask, or on the sailors in the sailor who fell from grace with the seaâ€” they do their job, but more than that, they are their job, and they both find purpose and acquire nobility not in freedom but in stricture.m. not as individuals but as perfect representatives of their roles, gifted with a purpose and a story by the modest yet utterly crucial and harmonious role they play in the broader community. If they die, they donâ€™t matter, but they die in poetic purityâ€” when they live they donâ€™t matter either, but in this immateriality they find the plain, modest nobility of the bee in the hiveâ€” more modest, and yet more noble than most can claim to be. does the flower embody perfection to the bee, mishima wonders, for the simple fact of its perfect utility? for their harmony together?</p>
