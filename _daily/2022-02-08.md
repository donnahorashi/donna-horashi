Oysters

7. Oysters ship with harvest tags, which you should be able to inspect, said Mr. Bil. East Coast oysters are typically good for two weeks from harvest; West Coast up to 10 days, tops. Either way, they should be tightly closed, feel heavy and smell unimpeachably fresh. When you give a fresh, healthy oyster a squeeze, it won't leak any fluid.
